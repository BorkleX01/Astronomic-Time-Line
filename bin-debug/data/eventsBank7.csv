Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed..."

This enrichment is typical of carbon compounds produced by photosynthesis. This evidence is not convincing to everyone..."

5		-3500000000	"Oldest Bacterial Fossils (microfossils)"	"Oldest Bacterial Fossils.jpg"	"Fossil bacteria are hard to find! When it comes to the oldest of them, it's hard to be sure these microscopic shapes in ancient rocks are truly the remains of living creatures rather than funny mineral forms. The most recent discovery seems pretty convincing, though..."	"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html"

Although some are single-celled, they can also form multi-cellular complex organisms, such as plants and animals. The oldest evidence are not proper fossils but instead organic molecules in ancient rocks that are the remains of molecules probably produced by ancient eukaryotes..."	"none"

11		-575000000	"Oldest Animal Fossils (Ediacara)"	"Oldest Animal Fossils.jpg"	"The oldest animal fossils are enigmatic shapes preserved in sedimentary rocks found from the same period on multiple continents.

13		-470000000	"Oldest Land Plant Fossils"	"Oldest Land Plant Fossils.jpg"	"Adjusting from life in the water to life on land is no easy task.  Ultraviolet radiation, desiccation, and nutrient acquisition are just some of the hurdles early land plants needed to overcome.  The first evidence for liverworts, a simple kind of plant, appeared in the form of spores."	"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryophyte"
14		-428000000	"Oldest Land Animal Fossils"	"Oldest Land Animal Fossils.jpg"	"After plants conquered the land, animals were not far behind.

16		-230000000	"Oldest Dinosaur Fossils"	"Oldest Dinosaur Fossils.jpg"	"Dinosaurs stepped onto the scene with the evolution of Eoraptor, an archosaur whose distinguishing characteristic was a unique hip structure that differed from precursor reptiles by bringing the legs under the body, allowing dinosaurs to expand into many new niches."	"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur"
17		-65000000	"Dinosaur Extinction"	"Dinosaur Extinction.jpg"	"The extinction of the dinosaurs was a rapid event, geologically speaking. Today, it is widely accepted that collision of the Earth with a 10 km asteroid or comet probably caused this extinction, although many argue that the Earth's environment was already stressed by other factors..."

19		-3000000	"Ice Ages Begin"	"Ice Ages Begin.jpg"	"There have been several eras of extensive glaciation in Earth's history. We are living in the most recent such era, which geologists call the ‘Quaternary Period’. During this era, permanent ice sheets developed in Antarctica and possibly Greenland. These ice sheets expanded and contracted in dramatic cycles – ‘ice ages’ - roughly every 100,000 years…"	"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation"
20		-20000	"Last Glacial Maximum"	"Last Glacial Maximum.jpg"	"When the last major ice age reached its peak, a sheet of ice about 2 miles thick covered much of North America. Geologists and climate scientists call that time the ‘last glacial maximum’. Modern human civilization arose after that ice sheet retreated."	"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum"
21		-10000	"Agriculture Invented"	"Agriculture Invented.jpg"	"Advancing glaciers ground bedrock to fine powder. When they retreated, they left behind rich soil and networks of rivers and lakes. Some scholars suspect that agriculture was invented as a consequence, leading eventually to the rise of cities and technology. You may be reading this because of ancient climate change!"

30		900000000	"Biosphere Collapses"	"Biosphere Collapses.jpg"	"As the Sun ages, it grows brighter. As it grows brighter, the Earth grows warmer, which increases the rate at which the weathering of rocks consumes CO₂ in the atmosphere. This very slow process, happening over hundreds of millions of years, will eventually reduce CO₂ in the atmosphere to levels below that needed to sustain photosynthesis. At that point, the biosphere as we know it will collapse…"	"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11536510"
31		2500000000	"Evaporation of the Oceans"	"Evaporation of the Oceans.jpg"	"Eventually, the Earth will be warm enough that large amounts of water evaporate and rise to the Earth's upper atmosphere. There, the H₂O molecules are broken by ultraviolet light and the H atoms escape to space. The Earth will then become a water-free planet, much like modern-day Venus."

32		5400000000	"Death of the Earth"	"Death of the Earth.jpg"	"The Sun's energy comes from the conversion of hydrogen to helium by nuclear fusion. In the distant future, the hydrogen will all be gone. At that point, the Sun will swell into a red giant, expanding to engulf the Earth's orbit. That will be a very bad day for anything still living on the planet."
